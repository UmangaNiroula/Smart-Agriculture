# Elevator Pitch
This project demonstrates the integration of IoT devices with agriculture to create a smart farming system. It utilizes sensors like DHT11 for temperature and humidity and a soil moisture sensor, all connected through Node MCU with an ESP8266 chip. Data collected from the sensors is transmitted to a Firebase real-time database, where it is analyzed and used to optimize farming processes. The project also includes an Android application for real-time monitoring, providing an efficient and automated approach to modern agriculture, reducing waste, and increasing productivity.

## User Guidelines

1.	User Guidelines

This guideline is for end-users who have installed “Smart Agriculture” and are looking for an instruction to fully understand the usage of the application. Therefore, multiple instructions intended to help the end user understand the app are provided below: 

1.1.	Selecting Crop

The purpose of this application is to help end users (farmers) to better their farming through incorporation of technologies. Hence, understanding the crop type is a very crucial part for using this application. Smart Agriculture makes it easy for the end user to enter crop details as the dashboard contains “Add Crops” option as highlighted in figure 1 by a rectangle brown box. 

<img width="296" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-12 at 6 49 15 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53705624/173234612-e4ea050c-4143-42b5-9757-181da607fcc0.png">

Figure 1: Dashboard of Smart Agriculture


After selecting the crop following page will be shown on the mobile screen. This is demonstrated by figure 2. After choosing any of the provided option the database will automatically add data relating to the particular crop.
 
<img width="294" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-12 at 7 20 03 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53705624/173235812-e2cb268a-0e81-451d-965d-9297c3844511.png">

Figure 2: Choose Crop Page

For example, if the end user wants the sensor to read data for rice, the rice option should be selected as shown in figure 3. Also, a message will be displayed alerting the end user’s action which is also shown in figure 3.

1.3.	Moisture, Temperature, and Humidity Log

The whole concept of better farming revolves around data, the more data is accumulated the more accurate prediction can be given such as if the temperature and humidity is favorable for growing a particular crop. Hence, identifying these parameters on a daily basis is important for which log are created. Following figure 6 shown the options for the moisture, temperature, and humidity log.
